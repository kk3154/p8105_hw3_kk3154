## Problem 1 - Exploring Instacart Data

Loading data from p8105.datasets:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

1.1 Describe the dataset, including size and structure of the data, key
variables, and giving illustrative examples of observations.

1.2 How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
ordered from?

1.3 Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

1.4 Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

1.5 Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

## Problem 2 - Cleaning and Exploring BRFSS Data

Loading the BRFSS data:

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```
